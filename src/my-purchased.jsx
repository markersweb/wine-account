In the expert hands of leading Minervois estate Château Millegrand, it excels. A lovely balance of spicy, floral, ripe fruit and stony, lemon freshness.","longDescription":"If you are looking for a luscious, exotic flavoured white with a flash of minerality and real elegance, head this way. This wine is pure Viognier, a variety that used only to be found in the Rhône's pricy Condrieu wines. Although cellars all over the world try to emulate this style, great examples like Oratoire are relatively rare. It's made by the Bonfils family, whose winemaking traditions stretch back to 1870. Jean-Michel Bonfils purchased Château Millegrand in 1962 and today it's one of the south's leading estates, ranked by Dussert-Gerber as a Premier Grand Vin Classé. Although a specialist in Minervois reds, the estate is clearly just as adept at beautifully balanced whites. Perfect with lightly spicy Thai dishes, sushi or seafood.","webHeadline":"Exotic, aromatic Viognier - a tropical fruit scented classic from a top southern French estate","styleName":"Medium-bodied dry white","styleId":"02","grapeName":"Viognier","grapeId":"40","appellationName":"Pays d'Oc IGP","appellationId":"FR0675","regionName":"Southern France","regionId":"050","countryName":"France","countryId":"FR","colourName":"White","colourId":"White","vintage":"2014","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13015.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13015b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13015.png","enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladePerson":"Online Review for 2010","accoladeNameText":"Tremaine, Cornwall","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"Lovely fruit flavours of mango, apricot and a little ginger are all there to delight your palate","categoryId":"11","awardingCountry":"NA","id":"13303253"}],"vppQualifier":true,"tastingNotes":{"shortTastingNotesColor":"Pale straw","shortTastingNotesAroma":"Spiced apricots, peaches and floral aromas","shortTastingNotesTaste":"Beautifully rich yet fresh with ripe apricot character.

It wasn't until 2001, when Alain and Bruno took the reins, that they made the move to start creating and bottling wine under their own name. This delicious Sauvignon caught the attention of our Buyer Mark Hoddy in a recent tasting and he moved quickly to secure it exclusively for our customers. It has a lovely grapefruit and fresh herb aroma with impressive ripeness and balance. Enjoy on its own or with seafood or a green salad with grilled goat's cheese.","webHeadline":"Gold medal winning Loire Sauvignon from third generation growers in the heart of Touraine","styleName":"Medium-bodied dry white","styleId":"02","grapeName":"Sauvignon Blanc","grapeId":"19","appellationName":"Touraine AOP","appellationId":"FR0855","regionName":"Loire","regionId":"043","countryName":"France","countryId":"FR","colourName":"White","colourId":"White","vintage":"2014","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13226.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13226b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13226.png","enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladePerson":"Mark Hoddy","accoladeNameText":"Buyer for the Loire","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"Ideal for days when a Kiwi is too much and a Sancerre too pricey.

Javier's family have long been prominent players in Rioja Alavesa and he recently launched a new winery in El Ciego for his non-Rioja wines. Javier scoured Spain for the most tempting parcels of wine, and, knowing that the Aussies have been making great cross-regional blends for years, he saw no reason why he couldn't, too. Here you have citrusy Verdejo from Rueda, crisp Malvasia from Rioja and Viura from La Mancha. The result is terrific and cheaper because wine law dictates such blends be sold as a table wine.

That freshness comes through in the wine, which balances ripe peach and melon flavours with a subtle hint of vanilla scented oak. Crisp enough to enjoy as an apéritif; great too with chicken casserole, halloumi and nectarine salad or seafood pancakes.","webHeadline":"Gently oaked, fruit-filled Chardonnay overflowing with southern French zesty ripeness and charm","styleName":"Medium-bodied dry white","styleId":"02","grapeName":"Chardonnay","grapeId":"3","appellationName":"Pays d'Oc IGP","appellationId":"FR0675","regionName":"Southern France","regionId":"050","countryName":"France","countryId":"FR","colourName":"White","colourId":"White","vintage":"2015","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13571.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13571b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13571.png","lowestPricePerBottle":9.49,"enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladePerson":"Online Review for 2013","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"Best Chardonnay I've had in years!

It can produce terrific fresh whites, too. Here is a Reserve Chardonnay from Finca La Escondida, the name of which means hidden vineyard.

This brings out the aromatic freshness in the grapes and allows for a long ripening time - all good for vibrant, flavoursome wine.

Italian wine expert Burton Anderson describes Gavi as having a \"cleanly refined scent and acutely dry flavour with pronounced acidity countered by a vague sensation of fruit.

They vinified the fruit in the shed just for their own consumption. All this fascinated Alessandro as he was growing up, and then became his chosen career. For a number of years he's been president of an important local winery, but in 2010 he started up on his own.

In 1907 vignerons and growers in the Languedoc rebelled against the diluted wines flooding France and undermining their livelihoods - and laid the foundations for today's appellation contrôlée system. This Chardonnay honours their stand and is named after their leader, Marcelin Albert. It also strikes a blow for a grape that's suffered an image crisis in recent years.

The glacier carved local geology and gravelly soils here lend the grapes and final wine a crisp, mineral edge. But what you'll notice first is the wine's mellow softness and delicious complexity, and tiny long-lasting bubbles that are created by a secondary in-bottle fermentation.

At the pioneering RedHeads Studio, their true genius can be unleashed on some of the greatest fruit there is to offer.

It started in a shed in the premium McLaren Vale, equipped ingeniously with others' old kit and carefully restored. The cellar has recently been 'reborn' in the Barossa to lend a new creative boost, under the guidance of hot-shot Aussie winemaker Dan Graham.

From a low yielding, superb vintage, Aluado is a big, rich wine best served with roast meats - try with pork or rack of lamb.","webHeadline":"Inky black, special project star from the acknowledged master of Portuguese wine","styleName":"Medium-bodied red","styleId":"07","grapeName":"Other Red","grapeId":"10","appellationName":"Vinho Regional de Lisboa","appellationId":"PT0025","regionName":"Estremadura","regionId":"034","countryName":"Portugal","countryId":"PT","colourName":"Red","colourId":"Red","vintage":"2014","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/66608.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/66608b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/66608.png","enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"International Wine & Spirit Competition","accoladeStandardText":"Bronze","accoladeCategoryText":"Bronze","categoryId":"4","awardingCountry":"GB","id":"13301939"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"International Wine Challenge","accoladeStandardText":"Silver","accoladeCategoryText":"Silver","categoryId":"3","awardingCountry":"GB","id":"13301940"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"Mundus Vini International Wine Competition","accoladeStandardText":"Gold","accoladeCategoryText":"Gold","categoryId":"2","awardingCountry":"DE","id":"13301941"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"Premium Wine Select Challenge, Germany","accoladeStandardText":"Silver","accoladeCategoryText":"Silver","categoryId":"3","awardingCountry":"DE","id":"13301942"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"Wine Enthusiast Magazine","accoladeStandardText":"90 Points","accoladeCategoryText":"Uncategorized","categoryId":"999","awardingCountry":"GB","id":"13301943"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"Wine Enthusiast Magazine","accoladeStandardText":"Best Buy","accoladeCategoryText":"Uncategorized","categoryId":"999","awardingCountry":"GB","id":"13301944"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"New York International Wine Competition","accoladeStandardText":"Bronze","accoladeCategoryText":"Bronze","categoryId":"4","awardingCountry":"US","id":"13301945"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladePerson":"Online Review for 2011","accoladeNameText":"Bedfordshire","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"Wow!

We think he's 'blended a blinder' as the locals say. It's firm and full, yet abundant in gloriously ripe, liquorice and spice scented fruit with an underlying note of oak.

When we initially featured this luscious Grenache Shiraz Mataro, it flew from our cellars. So when our Buyer got wind of a forgotten second batch, he was on to it like a shot.

Aussie winemaking legend Peter Lehmann once said \"When God created Shiraz, he did so with the Barossa in mind.\" And when Shiraz is married to Grenache and Mataro you get an even more heavenly result - ripe black fruit with a powerful, spicy edge and silky textures.

Well, the region does lie just a Mont Ventoux away from Châteauneuf du Pape. Les Messes du Prieuré is made from classic southern French varieties which thrive on the clay and limestone soils. Winemaker Alain Giraud treats the wine to a slow fermentation at a low temperature to capture maximum fruit. Enjoy this top vintage red solo or with sausage cassoulet, rich pasta dishes or a roasted vegetable tart.","webHeadline":"Outstanding southern Rhône style charmer from the vine-clad slopes of Mont Ventoux","styleName":"Medium-bodied red","styleId":"07","grapeName":"Syrah","grapeId":"21","appellationName":"Ventoux AOC","appellationId":"FR0256","regionName":"Rhone","regionId":"072","countryName":"France","countryId":"FR","colourName":"Red","colourId":"Red","vintage":"2015","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/67549.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/67549b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/67549.png","lowestPricePerBottle":9.49,"enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2016","accoladePerson":"Hilario Ribeiro","accoladeNameText":"Buyer for the Rhône","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"The Ventoux hills are home to many great reds - for the money, this is one of the best","categoryId":"11","awardingCountry":"NA","id":"17500268"}],"vppQualifier":true,"tastingNotes":{"shortTastingNotesColor":"Deep purplish red","shortTastingNotesAroma":"Ripe red berry aromas with a sweet, earthy complexity","shortTastingNotesTaste":"Ripe, spicy red fruits, smooth tannins; intensity and finesse","largeBottleImageFile":"LRB_67549","mapImageFile":"LRM_france_rhone_ventoux","otherImageFile":"LRI_ventoux_jefford"},"inventoryInfo":{"availabilityStatus":1001,"summaryAvailabilityStatus":"out_of_stock","backOrderLevel":0,"stockQty":0,"happyToWaitEnabled":false},"drinkByDate":1546214400000,"serveCode":"18","alcoholPercent":14.5,"alcoholUnits":10.875,"bottleSize":"75","productType":"wine","subProductType":"Z022","hasSubstitution":false,"flexiMatrixFlag":false,"unitOfMeasure":"CL","genericGrapeName":"Syrah-based blend","genericGrapeId":"080","giftFlag":false,"unlimitedItem":false,"winePlanFlag":false,"mixed":false,"ratingDetails":{"productRating":{"avgRating":3.7,"numberOfReviews":9,"roundAvgRating":4.0}},"drinkByDateAsString":"31 December, 2018"},"userItemDetails":{"associatedListId":"71936792","lastUpdatedDate":1471623677000,"quantityPurchased":1,"lastOrderId":"71936792","lastShipmentDate":1471623677000},"whereUsed":{"inFavourites":true,"inPurchaseHistory":false,"inUserRatedWines":false,"inRecentlyBrowsedList":false,"inRecommendationsList":false,"inAntiFavouritesList":false},"ratingDetails":{"productRating":{"avgRating":3.7,"numberOfReviews":9,"roundAvgRating":4.0}}},{"product":{"skus":[{"id":"esku1401873","itemCode":"Q67572","listPrice":12.99,"salePrice":12.99,"preSellItem":false,"preReleaseItem":false,"webEnabled":true,"stockHeld":false,"numberOfBottles":1,"salePricePerBottle":12.99,"vppApplier":true,"vppPrice":11.69,"vppDiscountPct":10.0,"salesCode":"Q6757200","currentSalesCode":"Q6757200","salesCodeDetails":{"addOn":false,"installments":[],"outBound":false,"marginPercent":0.0},"caseType":"Straight Case"}],"id":"eprod1320574","itemCode":"67572","name":"Hèdonè Rosso","description":"If you enjoy the ripe, velvety, ageworthy reds of a Super Tuscan, but perhaps not the price, try this outstanding Umbrian red.

It was carefully crafted in the darkest corner of the cellar. Why? Because it's the special project of rising star winemaker David Joeky and he didn't want anyone to take a look or taste it until he was absolutely ready. So every evening, after the rest of the crew had left, David would retire to the furthest corner of the cellar, where he'd stationed his special tanks of dark, spicy Durif and ripest, peppery Shiraz. We think he's 'blended a blinder' as the locals say. It's firm and full, yet abundant in gloriously ripe, liquorice and spice scented fruit with an underlying note of oak.

For drinking now or cellaring, it's spot on with grilled meats and many sorts of tapas.","webHeadline":"Wonderfully mellow Navarra Crianza, long aged in barrel, combines Tempranillo, Cabernet and Garnacha","styleName":"Medium-bodied red","styleId":"07","grapeName":"Tempranillo","grapeId":"24","appellationName":"Navarra DO","appellationId":"ES0021","regionName":"Navarra","regionId":"056","countryName":"Spain","countryId":"ES","colourName":"Red","colourId":"Red","vintage":"2010","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/68774.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/68774b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/68774.png","lowestPricePerBottle":8.99,"enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2017","accoladePerson":"Beth Willard","accoladeNameText":"Buyer for Spain","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"A rare parcel of seven year old Crianza from Navarra and an exemplary cellar.

Fermented at a cool temperature for extra freshness, this superb Chardonnay makes an appetising glass with chicken, creamy pasta or fish pie.","webHeadline":"Rediscover great Chardonnay with this crisp, richly satisfying southern French favourite","styleName":"Light and refreshing dry white","styleId":"01","grapeName":"Chardonnay","grapeId":"3","appellationName":"Pays d'Oc IGP","appellationId":"FR0675","regionName":"Southern France","regionId":"050","countryName":"France","countryId":"FR","colourName":"White","colourId":"White","vintage":"2014","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13272.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13272b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/13272.png","enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2016","accoladePerson":"Beth Willard","accoladeNameText":"Buyer for Southern France","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"Superb expression of the new breed of fresh, aromatic and utterly delicious Languedoc Chardonnays","categoryId":"11","awardingCountry":"NA","id":"16504448"},{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladeNameText":"Guide des Vins Gilbert et Gaillard","accoladeStandardText":"Gold","accoladeCategoryText":"Gold","categoryId":"2","awardingCountry":"FR","id":"16504449"}],"vppQualifier":true,"tastingNotes":{"shortTastingNotesColor":"Pale green gold","shortTastingNotesAroma":"Stony white peach and melon with a lemony note","shortTastingNotesTaste":"Creamy, round texture and racy lemon and lime flavours","largeBottleImageFile":"LRB_13272_mock_edit","mapImageFile":"LRM_france_languedoc","otherImageFile":"LRI_languedoc_scenery_2"},"drinkByDate":1530313200000,"serveCode":"10","alcoholPercent":13.5,"alcoholUnits":10.125,"bottleSize":"75","productType":"wine","subProductType":"Z021","hasSubstitution":false,"flexiMatrixFlag":false,"unitOfMeasure":"CL","genericGrapeName":"Chardonnay","genericGrapeId":"014","giftFlag":false,"unlimitedItem":false,"winePlanFlag":false,"mixed":false,"ratingDetails":{"productRating":{"avgRating":3.5,"numberOfReviews":33,"roundAvgRating":4.0}},"drinkByDateAsString":"30 June, 2018"},"userItemDetails":{"associatedListId":"73325204","lastUpdatedDate":1487093098000,"quantityPurchased":3,"lastOrderId":"73325204","lastShipmentDate":1487093098000},"whereUsed":{"inFavourites":true,"inPurchaseHistory":false,"inUserRatedWines":false,"inRecentlyBrowsedList":false,"inRecommendationsList":false,"inAntiFavouritesList":false},"ratingDetails":{"productRating":{"avgRating":3.5,"numberOfReviews":33,"roundAvgRating":4.0}}},{"product":{"skus":[],"id":"eprod1010186","itemCode":"13283","name":"Lupé-Cholet Chablis","description":"Since 1903 Lupé-Cholet have been one of Burgundy's leading négociants.

They vinified the fruit in the shed just for their own consumption. All this fascinated Alessandro as he was growing up, and then became his chosen career. For a number of years he's been president of an important local winery, but in 2010 he started up on his own. Made with grapes selected from top areas - Colli Orientali and Grave - this wine delivers delicate pear fruit and crisp minerally 'zing'.

In 1907 vignerons and growers in the Languedoc rebelled against the diluted wines flooding France and undermining their livelihoods - and laid the foundations for today's appellation contrôlée system. This Chardonnay honours their stand and is named after their leader, Marcelin Albert. It also strikes a blow for a grape that's suffered an image crisis in recent years.

Always made from pure Chardonnay, this is never revealed on the label because the flavour and character of the wine is more about the terroir than the grape. Terroir is a French word that encompasses soil, aspect, climate and every other natural factor that influences the flavour of a wine. The best sites consist of limestone overlaid by Kimmeridgian clay, packed with decomposed marine fossils. The climate is cool yet with plentiful sunshine thanks to the bowl shaped lie of the land.

It's wonderfully lush and ripe, as you'd expect from the New World, but also with a crisp bite of minerality.

A true pioneer, Emilio was the first person to plant vineyards in Colchagua, and today, 125 years later, the fifth generation of his family are in charge. The elegance of this white is due to the proximity of the vineyards to the ocean - just 8 kilometres inland - so vines are cooled by coastal fogs and sea breezes. This lends a stony freshness to Viognier's inherent exotic peach fruit and spicy richness.

It is only since the 1980s that Riesling has been grown in any volume in New Zealand, but it's quickly risen to be the fourth most planted white grape. Like many others, this Riesling comes from cool climate Marlborough. Unlike many others, it's crafted by ex-head winemaker of Cloudy Bay Eveline Fraser. And it's her passion, experience and talent that makes this an unforgettable white. It has the vibrancy of the country's celebrated Sauvginons but also irresistible mineral intensity and rich fruit concentration - the hallmarks of great Riesling.

Such has been his success that several big Champagne houses have made overtures to buy the property, but the family is having none of it. They named this wine after an Englishman, Christopher Merret, who discovered the process of making traditional method sparkling wines some decades before the Champenois, presenting his findings to London's Royal Society in 1662!

What they are saying is that the quality of the grapes, determined by terroir, vintage and yield, determines the quality of the wine, and no amount of intervention in the cellar can turn average juice into great wine. In Bordeaux in 2010, fruit quality was unbelievable - possibly the best ever. Add to that the age of the vines at this third generation estate - over 30 years - and the skill of winemaker and owner Patrick Gresta and you have a luscious, rich and long flavoured claret.

How appropriate for an affordable Aussie red of peerless intensity and popularity.

It was carefully crafted in the darkest corner of the cellar. Why? Because it's the special project of rising star winemaker David Joeky and he didn't want anyone to take a look or taste it until he was absolutely ready. So every evening, after the rest of the crew had left, David would retire to the furthest corner of the cellar, where he'd stationed his special tanks of dark, spicy Durif and ripest, peppery Shiraz. We think he's 'blended a blinder' as the locals say. It's firm and full, yet abundant in gloriously ripe, liquorice and spice scented fruit with an underlying note of oak.

It gives the fruit a longer time to ripen, developing complex Shiraz character whilst retaining a balancing acidity. The result is a hearty, full-throttle red, that's never overpowering. Great sipped solo, it's also worth trying with a spicy pepper steak or strong cheese.","webHeadline":"Good, honest Aussie Shiraz that's guaranteed to warm the cockles, no matter how cold!","styleName":"Full-bodied, rich red","styleId":"08","grapeName":"Shiraz","grapeId":"22","appellationName":"South Eastern Australia","appellationId":"AU0008","regionName":"SE Australia","regionId":"075","countryName":"Australia","countryId":"AU","colourName":"Red","colourId":"Red","vintage":"2015","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/68111.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/68111b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/68111.png","enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2016","accoladePerson":"Dan Parrott","accoladeNameText":"Buyer for Australia","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"If, like me, you're partial to a drop of full flavoured Aussie Shiraz, you can't go wrong with this","categoryId":"11","awardingCountry":"NA","id":"18800741"}],"vppQualifier":true,"tastingNotes":{"shortTastingNotesColor":"Deep, purplish red","shortTastingNotesAroma":"Loads of upfront, ripe black fruit with a generous lick of spice","shortTastingNotesTaste":"Bramble, blackcurrant, plum and damson - generous, mouthfilling stuff","largeBottleImageFile":"LRB_68111","mapImageFile":"LRM_australia_southeasternaustralia","otherImageFile":"LRI_australia_shirazgrape"},"drinkByDate":1609372800000,"serveCode":"18","alcoholPercent":13.5,"alcoholUnits":10.125,"bottleSize":"75","productType":"wine","subProductType":"Z022","hasSubstitution":false,"flexiMatrixFlag":false,"unitOfMeasure":"CL","genericGrapeName":"Shiraz","genericGrapeId":"077","giftFlag":false,"unlimitedItem":false,"winePlanFlag":false,"mixed":false,"ratingDetails":{"productRating":{"avgRating":3.7,"numberOfReviews":155,"roundAvgRating":4.0}},"drinkByDateAsString":"31 December, 2020"},"userItemDetails":{"associatedListId":"73181219","lastUpdatedDate":1485277865000,"quantityPurchased":1,"lastOrderId":"73181219","lastShipmentDate":1485277865000},"whereUsed":{"inFavourites":true,"inPurchaseHistory":false,"inUserRatedWines":false,"inRecentlyBrowsedList":false,"inRecommendationsList":false,"inAntiFavouritesList":false},"ratingDetails":{"productRating":{"avgRating":3.7,"numberOfReviews":155,"roundAvgRating":4.0}}},{"product":{"skus":[{"id":"esku1720592","itemCode":"Q68131","listPrice":10.99,"salePrice":10.99,"preSellItem":false,"preReleaseItem":false,"webEnabled":true,"stockHeld":false,"numberOfBottles":1,"salePricePerBottle":10.99,"vppApplier":true,"vppPrice":9.89,"vppDiscountPct":10.0,"salesCode":"Q6813100","currentSalesCode":"Q6813100","salesCodeDetails":{"addOn":false,"installments":[],"outBound":false,"marginPercent":0.0},"caseType":"Straight Case"}],"id":"eprod1640220","itemCode":"68131","name":"Valcatrina Tinto","description":"Here's a wine to prove Portugal is a treasure trove of quality and value - Valcatrina.

Well, Adelaide's Cooper family have been making beer that's the envy of brewers around the world since 1862. That's when Thomas Cooper, attempting to make a health tonic, brewed his first beer by accident. One very happy accident. And one remarkable tasting beer. 'Natural ale from natural ingredients' has been their mantra ever since, epitomised by their now legendary 'Red Label' sparkling ale. Like Champagne, the bubbles are created by a secondary, in-bottle fermentation, adding a subtle sparkle to the fruity hop and rich malt flavours. This leaves a little sediment, which connoisseurs gently mix into the beer by rocking the bottle prior to opening. 100% natural, 100% delicious.","webHeadline":"Naturally sparkling, full flavoured craft ale from Australia's oldest family owned brewery","styleName":"Beer","styleId":"12","appellationName":"South Australia","appellationId":"AU0007","regionName":"South Australia","regionId":"083","countryName":"Australia","countryId":"AU","colourName":"Other","colourId":"Other","vintage":"NV","smallImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/73356.png","largeImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/73356b.png","thumbnailImage":"/images/uk/en/law/product/73356.png","lowestPricePerBottle":1.99,"enPrimeurFlag":false,"accolades":[{"accoladeYear":"2015","accoladePerson":"Roger Protz","accoladeNameText":"beer-pages.com","accoladeStandardText":"QUOTE","accoladeCategoryText":"QUOTE","accoladeDescription":"A very classy beer with a tight grained bitter hoppiness.

This Limestone Coast Shiraz reflects, as always, the famed region's distinct terroir and the quality of its grapes, with free draining soils and cool conditions helping to intensify the varietal characters. You find aromas of toasty oak and sweet spices with chocolate and red plum flavours encased in soft tannins. Enjoy with slow roasted lamb or tomatoey pasta dishes.","webHeadline":"Renowned Aussie Shiraz from the prestigious Limestone Coast region.

Over two decades later Haut-Brion trained winemaker Jean-Marc Sauboua gets no less excited about his pride and joy - personally earmarking the best grapes from Sauveterre in the Entre Deux Mers and supervising every step of production. The result is a deliciously appetising white, with a perfect balance of grassy freshness, lemon and light tropical fruit and terrific zip.

So on 16th October 2016 the family slept peacefully in their beds, while out in the vineyard nature was wreaking havoc. Frost, the worse in a generation, descended on the vines and the whole vintage was wiped out in just hours. The family took solace in the cellars, and rediscovered a few barrels of Pinotage they sensibly put aside in bountiful years for emergencies like this. The wine was from the magnificent 2013 vintage and, with all its rich, bramble fruit, spice cake and toasty oak, it was obviously well worth putting aside. Named after the devastating black frost that struck, this wine has seductive richness and power.

Opi has thousands of fans around the world for medal winning wines like his eponymous Malbec, and The Waxed Bat, which already contains a healthy glug of high grown Cabernet. This grape thrives in Mendoza's healthy, higher altitude vineyards, which enjoy an ideal climate, cooling mountain breezes and irrigation from pure glacial snowmelt. Here, the cooler conditions give Opi's Cabernet vines a longer time to ripen, meaning the fruit develops more flavour and character. Smaller grapes with thicker skins mean Opi's Cabernet is deeper and richer than many.

Their small family estate is lovingly nurtured and the wines crafted by Elodie Dieudonné, a dynamic young winemaker who specialises in stunning rosé.
